# TableSweeper

**MineSweeper** horribly made with HTML tables in a few hours.
All in a single file (with the exception of jQuery, taken via cdn, and a favicon linked from `emojipedia.org`).
It allows to customize the board size and mines through a simple interface or through query params.

## The Why

I did this for a friend.
It was fun.

## How to run

By following 4 simple steps:
* first install `node v8` (or switch to it through `nvm`); `v8.1.11` is recommended, but any `v8` version should do the trick;
* then install `python 3` and `plotly 4.4.1` (`pip install plotly==4.4.1`);
* realize that this repo only contains a fucking HTML file;
* open the `index.html` file with a browser smart enough to understand the `let` and `const` statements; cursing me is optional.

Enjoy!
